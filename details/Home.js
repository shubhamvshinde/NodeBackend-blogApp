Alia Bhatt was in for a surprise as Ranbir had already been waiting for her arrival at the airport. Just a couple of days ago, Alia Bhatt had slammed reports of Ranbir going to pick Alia from her shoot location. However, she was in for a pleasant surprise when she saw him in the car. While it was a merry reunion of two lovebirds and soon-to-be parents, it is sad to see Ranbir getting massive flak online. It's for his posture and his drunk look. The paparazzi were waiting for Alia Bhatt at the airport when she came back after her professional trip abroad. They all thronged Alia and wished her on her pregnancy announcement. Alia received them all warmly and was visibly touched on seeing the outpour of love and warmth from the paps for her, Ranbir Kapoor and their baby. Alia Bhatt was unaware that Ranbir Kapoor was waiting for her in his car. Ranbir was seen engrossed in his phone. He did greet the paparazzi though he didn't come out of his car. We wonder if he was talking to Alia Bhatt on chat before surprising her at the airport.A lot has been said about Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor, and her pregnancy announcement within a couple of months after their wedding. Let's just keep love in mind, they are in love, they are expecting their first child together, let's celebrate that instead of churning out negativity all the time. "

                "description": "When we wake up, the first thing that comes to put mind is what to have for breakfast. After finishing it, we start thinking about lunch and then about dinner. This shows that food is one of the most important parts of our lives. One day we skip a meal, and our body starts reacting in a different way. While what we eat matters, another thing that plays a part is when we eat our meals. The time of having breakfast, lunch and dinner are vital to determine many health benefits. There is a common saying, “Early to bed, early to rise, makes us healthy, wealthy and wise.” Let’s turn it up a little and say, early dinner and early breakfast are all you need to be healthy and smart.Breakfast: Breakfast is the first meal of the day which makes our guts wake up. Usually, breakfast is eaten after 8 to 10 hours of having our dinner. The best time to have the first meal of the day is between 7 am to 9 am.Lunch: When you eat your breakfast early, it gives your stomach enough time to rest before you go on to your lunch. This aids digestion of breakfast. The best time to have lunch is between 12 noon to 2 pm. Dinner: As you have had your lunch early, you might feel hungry soon in the evening. Many dieticians recommend having early dinner in order to satisfy our hunger as well as boost metabolism. You should have your dinner between 6.30 pm to 8 pm.  If you have all your meals on a scheduled time daily, then it can help you boost your metabolism. In the morning, your metabolic rate works best, and as the day passes, it slows down. Therefore, having an early breakfast gives it a boost and an early dinner help it sustain."

Never officially diagnosed, he fears this has led people to believe he’s remote, aloof, inaccessible, and self-absorbed.Nobody believes me, Pitt told the interviewer, and it’s not difficult to understand why.However, as unusual as it may sound, prosopagnosia is a real condition that can present unique challenges to those who are living with it."

Top Gun came out in 1986, establishing Cruise, then 24, as an action hero. He’s nearly 60 now, promoted to US Navy captain in the sequel, and working hard to recreate the magic from 36 years ago.Director Joseph Kosinski's Top Gun Maverick, which features Tom Cruise, had a contrasting opening at the box office in India and the US. In the US, the film collected $51 million on its opening day. The film is already Tom’s best opening day ever beating Mission Impossible – Fallout's first-day collection. However, the film has not been able to make a mark in India and collected ₹4.75 crore on day one. In Top Gun Maverick, Tom essays the role of Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, who is grappling with the diminished standing of fighter pilots in a world that now wages war with drones controlled by people miles away on computers. Top Gun Maverick is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Tom Cruise, Christopher McQuarrie and David Ellison.As per a Deadline report, Top Gun Maverick at this Friday night hour is on its way to a $51 million opening day (which includes $19.3 million previews). It would not be shocking to wake up on Saturday morning and see that the sequel has edged out Iron Man 2 ($51.2M) to become Paramount’s top opening day ever. Already, the sequel is Tom Cruise’s best opening day ever in US/Canada besting Mission: Impossible – Fallout‘s first day of $22.8M by 124%."
