Now, the jury will deliberate over the case’s facts and findings and deliver their verdict next week. The high-profile defamation trial has seen its fair share of twists and turns. But now the question on everyone’s lips is what would be the outcome. As per reports, Johnny Depp is heavily favoured to emerge victorious in his suit against his ex-wife. But if he does win, what does that mean for Amber? We take a look.Johnny has sued Amber for $50 million saying she defamed him when she claimed to be a victim of domestic violence in a Washington Post op-ed in 2018. Johnny’s lawyers have said that even though Amber didn’t name him, the implication damaged his career. He has further alleged that Amber was abusive towards him during their marriage. Amber has countersued him for $100 million claiming that he has smeared her name by calling her a liar. She has maintained that she suffered physical and sexual abuse at Johnny’s hands. Both trials ran concurrently in a Virginia court for over six weeks. The hearings ended on May 27."

I strongly believe that acting is not real life in any form,” Gyllenhaal tells us.It’s been over three decades since Gyllenhaal has been working his way through in Hollywood, bringing different shades of complicated men on screen from cons to police officers. He is known for films such as Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, Zodiac, Nightcrawler, Spider-Man: Far from Home, The Guilty and Ambulance.Opening up about his method as an actor, the 41-year-old shares, “A lot of times people say that acting is pretend. I don’t believe acting is pretend. I think it’s a real access to your imagination and a sense of play. And then you can hopefully build the human you are with the stuff that has nothing to do with the acting, but more to do with life and the people you love and the things you go through good and bad”"

Despite his stardom, Tom has never had a film gross over $100 million on the opening weekend. But reports say that Maverick may just change that. Some estimates claim that the film could end up making $125 million in its opening weekend in the domestic market alone.According to a report in The Hollywood Reporter, “Top Gun 2 is easily headed for the biggest opening of Tom Cruise’s career at the domestic box office, with a four-day gross of at least $92 million, according to official tracking. And that’s a conservative estimate. Many pundits believe the critically acclaimed sequel could soar well north of $100 million domestically, but tracking — one of Hollywood’s favorite pastimes — has become fraught in the pandemic era. Exhibitors are especially bullish on the pic, and are even thinking $125 million-plus.”"
